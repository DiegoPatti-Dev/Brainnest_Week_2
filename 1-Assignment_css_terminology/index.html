      <li class="question">
        What are the main differences between external, internal, and inline CSS?
        <ul>
          <li class="answer">
            Internal CSS requires you to add style tag in the head section of your HTML document.<br>
            With external CSS, you'll link your web pages to an external .css file, which can be created by any text editor in your device.<br>
            Inline CSS is used to style a specific HTML element. For this CSS style, you'll only need to add the style attribute to each HTML tag, without using selectors.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li class="question">
        What is the syntax for class and ID selectors?
        <ul>
          <li class="answer">
            The dot symbol, along with the class name, is used to select the desired class. <br>
            The hashtag symplo and the id of the HTML element name are used to select the desired element.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li class="question">
        How would you apply a single rule to two different selectors?
        <ul>
          <li class="answer">
            To apply a single rule to two different selector, you need to group the selectors and use comma to separete them.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li class="question">
        Given an element that has an id of title and a class of primary, how would you use both attributes for a single rule?
        <ul>
          <li class="answer">
            #title, .primary { rule }.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li class="question">
        What does the descendant combinator do?
        <ul>
          <li class="answer">
            The descendant combinator combines two selectors such that elements matched by the second selector are selected if they have an ancestor (parent, parent's parent, etc.) element matching the first selector.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li class="question">
        Between a rule that uses one class selector and a rule that uses three type selectors, which rule has the higher specificity?
        <ul>
          <li class="answer">
            The class selector is more specific than selectors.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li class="question">
        From inside to outside, what is the order of box-model properties?
        <ul>
          <li class="answer">
            Content, padding, border, margin.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li class="question">
        What does the box-sizing CSS property do?
        <ul>
          <li class="answer">
            The box-sizing property sets how the total width and height of an element is calculated.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li class="question">
        What is the difference between the standard and alternative box model?
        <ul>
          <li class="answer">
            If you are using the standard box model, the size of the border is added to the width and height of the content box. If you are using the alternative box model then the size of the border makes the content box smaller as it takes up some of the avaliable width and height of the element box.
